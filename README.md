## PokemonApp is a simple application to view pokemons.

## This application contains two modules:
* Pokemon list screen displaying information using UICollectionView
* A screen displaying detailed information about the Pok√©mon

## API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon

## NetworkManager is implemented with Moya

Moya is a Swift Network Abstraction Library. It provides us with an abstraction to make network calls without directly communicating with Alamofire.

## The DataBaseManager is implemented with Realm

Realm Swift is an easy to use alternative to SQLite and Core Data that makes persisting, querying, and syncing data as simple as working directly with native Swift objects.

## Image caching implemented with KingFisher

Kingfisher is a powerful, pure-Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web. It provides you a chance to use a pure-Swift way to work with remote images in your next app.
